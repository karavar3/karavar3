<h3> Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ </h3>

I'm Fego. I live in Turkey. I can speak Turkish,english and little bit portuguese. I am an Electrical and Electronics Engineer. I am a full time blockchain worker. I'm a tester and developer. I've been interested in blockcahin for a long time. I joined many different networks and 200+ Testnets. And btw I have a lot of experience in managing and organizing the Discord Server (creating channels, integrating and moderating bots, supporting and helping the community).

<h4>I believe the future is blockchain. I am happy to contribute to projects and the community. Making everything decentralized and reliable ðŸ¥‚</h4>
