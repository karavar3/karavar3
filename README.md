<h3> Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ </h3>

I am Fego. I live in Turkey. I can speak Turkish, English and a little Portuguese. I am an Electrical and Electronics Engineer. I am a full time blockchain employee. I am a tester and developer. I have been interested in blockchain for a long time (5+ years). I have joined many different networks and 250+ Testnets. I am using Bare-Metal servers, monitored 24/7. I provide reliable and fast communication staking service. And by the way, I have a lot of experience managing and organizing Discord Server (creating channels, integrating and managing bots, supporting and helping the community). I enjoy testing testnets and providing feedback to the team! It's an honor to help the community!

<h4>I believe the future is blockchain. I am happy to contribute to projects and the community. Making everything decentralized and reliable ðŸ¥‚</h4>
